# manis

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Router, Hono, TRPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Router** - File-based routing with full type safety
- **React Native** - Build mobile apps using React
- **Expo** - Tools for React Native development
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **tRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs
- **workers** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **SQLite/Turso** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Husky** - Git hooks for code quality
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```
## Database Setup

This project uses SQLite with Drizzle ORM.

1. Start the local SQLite database:
```bash
cd apps/server && bun db:local
```


2. Update your `.env` file in the `apps/server` directory with the appropriate connection details if needed.

3. Apply the schema to your database:
```bash
bun db:push
```


Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
Use the Expo Go app to run the mobile application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).




## Before Deploying to Cloudflare

When you are ready to deploy your app to Cloudflare Workers, you'll have to make a couple changes.
- Change your url environment variables to match your `*.workers.dev` domains generated by Cloudflare:

```bash
# apps/web/.env
SERVER_URL={your-production-server-domain}

# apps/server/.env
CORS_ORIGIN={your-production-web-domain}
BETTER_AUTH_URL={your-production-server-domain}
```
- In `apps/server/src/lib/auth.ts`, uncomment the `session.cookieCache` and `advanced.crossSubDomainCookies` sections and replace `<your-workers-subdomain>` with your actual workers subdomain. These settings are required to ensure cookies are transferred properly between your web and server domains.



## Deployment (Alchemy)
- Dev: bun dev
- Deploy: bun deploy
- Destroy: bun destroy
